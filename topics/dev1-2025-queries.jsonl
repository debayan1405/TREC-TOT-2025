{"query_id": "531", "query": "I need help .\n Alright so I saw this movie sometime in the early 2000s it was in English and it was on tv but I know it was a movie. It was about a woman who at a young age lost her mother and almost died at the funeral but a ghost saved her and from that day on the ghost protected her, then one day once she was an adult she was at a party in an abandoned house I believe and she died at first her spirit is helping her avoid the demons hiding in the darkness after her soul, it was soon reviled that her guardian spirit is actually a demon as well and her mothers spirit is trying to help from what is presumably heaven and the woman has to get to I believe the kitchen and escape through some kind of ventilation shaft or something. Admittedly I was rather young when I saw this and could be mixing up or changing some details unknowingly so if you know a movie that sounds even remotely similar please let me know."}

It was definitely a movie. -Extras: in color, recently made, setting somewhere in Europe (Germany, France, UK) -Description: A woman wakes up in some secret underground apartment (I can\u2019t remember if she was kidnapped or otherwise ended up there another way). The resident of the apartment is a man who wears a mask and gloves, never taking them off. He makes her breakfast. The apartment is full of art and statues and books, almost museum-like. There\u2019s some fancy mirror somewhere and a scene takes place there. The woman at some point is in a cell where she is tortured every day. The only thing keeping her going is a letter she finds hidden in the wall that\u2019s a first hand account of a previous woman being tortured there. When she escapes she realizes the person holding her captive and torturing her was the masked/gloved man. She\u2019s furious and I think leaves. At some point it becomes known that the masked/gloved man was one of the people experimented on by the Angel of Death (Mengele), a nazi doctor who did experiments on twins, handicapped, elderly. The man was referred to as his cell number, and because of the experiments he developed super immunity to either disease (I think). There was a fire at the place where Mengele did the experiments and the man survived but had burns all over his body hence the mask and gloves. At some point the woman comes back. The police I think are after the masked man. I\u2019m not sure if he gets shot, but they\u2019re in the metro station and at some point the woman puts him (I think he was dying?) on a metro car full of flowers and bombs and sends it off to blow up. I think for some reason I can\u2019t remember there were protests going on in the general public that were taking place at the same time as this metro car explosion."}

Of course, the solid object went through the ghost and he actually beat his wife to death. Despondent , he thought that he saw his wife dancing in front of a window beckoning to him and he jumped through the window to his death.

Starts off with the inhabitants of a village all frantic to pack and flee as quickly as they can.   Every so many years this cult would return and bring evil with them. A young girls falls asleep or gets lost while playing with her friends in some tower or water mill type structure.  Her father stays behind searching for her. Two male backpackers traveling across the region wander into the village as the people are fleeing.  They disbelieve the legends told to them or could have not understood the meanings. The cult arrives after the dark falls and begins capturing villagers and hunting down anyone in the area.  Victims caught were hung on a cross and placed before a creature.  It would open its two arms wider revealing a third arm with three fingers extending from its chest.  When placed on the chest of the victim it would burn/brand them leaving a three fingered mark.  They would then become devoted followers. The father ends up being captured later on and he is branded. The two hikers are running down a stone staircase from some cultists when one of them falls.  With an injured leg he can no longer run so his friend pulls him aside and keeps running to lure away the cultists. I\u2019ve no idea who stars in it,   was before my mind payed attention to those parts of the movie.  I\u2019m sure there is more that happens but this bit is what my mind remembers the most."}

When people were about to die, they would hear the sea singing to them (I seem to recall that everyone present could hear it, not just the person dying. Also not sure if that was death in general, or just death by foot-worm). 3. There were doctors who would operate on people with \u201cmagic\u201d gloves that would allow them to reach into people\u2019s bodies without making incisions \u2013 there was some sort of training involved, and one of the main characters failed to save someone\u2019s life because he couldn\u2019t get the gloves to penetrate the patient\u2019s skin. 4. It was set in a Victorian-esque setting, with horse drawn carriages 5. There was a firm divide between an area of permanent darkness and an area of light (can\u2019t remember if the light area ever experienced night, but the dark one would never get day) 6. There was a scene where a king (or some such prominent royalty/courtier) was assassinated by having one of the aforementioned worms inserted into his food while he was sleeping (incidentally, this is the reason I cannot to this day sleep without my feet covered. As a kid this movie freaked me out, so no matter how hot it is, my feet must be covered.) 7. I remember a conversation in a carriage about weather balloons.

Where my memory gets fuzzy is that there may have been some monster/demonic presence/other evil involved and her limbs have been sacrificed in some way after she tried to escape, but I might be imagining this."}

The casualties begin acting stressed, then their eys turn black and then the alien rips out of their bodies. I remember two somewhat more specific occasions. One is a teacher / scientist that starts stressfully writing on the schoolboard, then crouches and the alien rips out of his back, long black nails first. Second is one where the nails come out of the victims face. I believe the movies starts with a girl jogging in a dark setting, some streetlights and may be foggy. Then the view point changes to something chasing her. Im not sure if what happens next is shown, but an important part in the first few scenes of the movie i also remember is a crime-scene with the two main characters: A woman, seemingly not from earth, covering a big out of space like big gun under a trenchcoat, and a man, probably police officer or FBI who sees that woman and knows something is fishy. The woman is there to catch / kill / recapture the alien. The guy helps her throughout the movie. There are several chasing scenes where people try to get away before being infected by the parasite like alien. I remember a scene that points out that coffee is something the woman has never had. And late in the movie I remember that a creature is captured inside a sealed room in spaceship / station. Not sure if its \u201cthe mother\u201d and if it escapes.

The girls were dressed in pink sweatshirts and sweatpants and jumped rope, while the boys were dressed in blue sweatpants and sweatshirts and shot basketballs through hoops. All the kids were in sync and did the exact same thing, and this black car drove up and down the road to make sure the kids were abiding by the rules (as in, doing whatever exercise they were supposed to based on gender). There was one boy who starts throwing his basketball at the garage door of his house, and he gets taken in the black car to some place that I guess was to brainwash him into abiding by the rules\u2026 And that\u2019s all I remember."}

He has an addiction to porn, the wife finds out and I think it really upset her. So the husband goes to his dad for advice, to figure how to fight for someone who doesn\u2019t love you anymore. The dad and mom are very Christian. The dad gives his son the idea of a book of I think 100 things to try and by the end of the book, he should win his wife\u2019s love back. (That\u2019s not an accurate count.) well he does it, surprises her with flowers, I think some breakfast and tries to take her out to dinner. By the end of the movie, he wins his wife and conquers his problem. At the end of the movie his father tells him that him and his mom had gone through the same thing, one lost love for the other and the other fought for the love back. The plot twist was that, even though the father was giving his son the advice he needed as if he had done the same thing, he actually tells his son that [he] had been the one to lose love for his mother and his mother was the one who had fought to get it back. Then the son goes back into his house where his mother and wife were, crying and apologized and hugged his mom. I believe it was because he had been avoiding her and didn\u2019t want anything to do with her assuming that she had put his through what he had gone. But that might not be correct. I hope that\u2019s enough to the answer of the title of this movie, I remember it and I\u2019ve been trying 1 year to find it and figure it out but I can\u2019t. If you know it or have any possible ideas that will lead me to it, let me know please. Thank you in advanced!"}

Late night b-movie, definitely in English and color.  Something I stumbled across while channel surfing one  night. All I can remember is a group of 3-4 people in the hills/mountains, running from some very large man/mutant.  Don\u2019t think it was intended to be bigfoot, as I seem to remember it was a giant, bald, deformed man, but who knows.  Someone was hanging over a cliff while others were trying to pull them back up.  The monster catches up to them and throws at least one over the edge, can\u2019t remember what happens to the others.  In short, all but one of the people is killed.  The survivor is a young lady who is abducted by the creature and taken back to his cave.  The closing shot of the movie is a fade on the cave entrance as you hear the sound of a baby crying, implying that the monster fathered a child with the girl. This is one of those cheesy films that I would love to see the rest of."}

{"query_id": "723", "query": "Scary car that scared my childhood .\n *not a native english speaker so bear with me* When I was a kid I lived in a small village and we had 2-3 channels on the TV. We would fall asleep watching the TV. Usually I was the last one to fall asleep and so could watch part of a horror movie until commercials came on and I fell asleep from boredom and the TV would run until morning, or I woke up later and caught the ending and turned off the TV. Just giving context ? this was about 10-13 years ago. This channel could only afford older movies but it was in color and english if it helps. So one night I fall asleep and wake up in the middle of the night to catch the middle-to-end of a horror movie. I can\u2019t remember exactly because it was a long time ago, but I can remember the ending very well because it scared the s*** out of me. So this family (father, mother, son and daughter) is running around in the woods, at night and they are screaming each others names. The son gets killed by a hook on the trees or some naked woman with a hook\u2026 maybe\u2026 The other 3 somehow make it back to the road to their car and quickly get in. The father steps on it. The mother notices that the son is missing so she wants to get out of the car to search for him. The father refuses to stop. The mother then starts saying she saw her mother (the grandma who wasn\u2019t in the movie). She starts screaming again that she wants out to search for her son and mother but the father and daughter start doubting the mothers sanity. She then sits quietly and suddenly jumps out of the car. Now they might have stopped right then or the daughter had to convince the father to go back I can\u2019t remember but she cracked her head and was dead. They put her on the back seat and drive on and keep passing by the same cabin. Here\u2019s some conversation they had: Daughter: \u201cWe\u2019ve been passing by that cabin all night\u201d Father: \u201cThis is a military road, all the cabins look the same\u201d *some arguing and desperation* Father: \u201cIf we keep driving we should be OK\u201d *of course they run out of gas* They keep talking, they get out and try to look around. The camera switches to the mother, she opens her eyes. When the father and daughter come back shes gone. They argue that she was surely dead or now is if she ran into the woods. Now the ending\u2026 The father somehow disappeared, can\u2019t remember how, and the daughter starts running. A black car, could have been a Black Volga, is chasing her. She trips, the car stops with the high beams right in her face *tension* the car backs off and as the lights start disappearing she wakes up in a hospital bed surrounded by people, might have been her family, I can\u2019t remember. So if it was her family maybe coma, if it wasn\u2019t maybe she was found. Spent years trying to find the movie, if it turn out to have been a dream I\u2019m going to feel really stupid."}
