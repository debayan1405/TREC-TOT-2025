It\u2019s like Stalker meets el Topo meets Holy Mountain meets Alphaville meets Delicatessen meets Hard to be a God, like Kurosawa, Tarkovsky, and Lynch had a kid together. It was color, possibly Russian, and I don\u2019t really remember the decade but want to say 60s or 70s, though could easily be more recent. It is VERY rare, there is only one crappy partial print of it, and that is what the youtube version is from. Lot of wide shots in a surreal wilderness, winter settings, strange bleeding saturation in some shots. Crazy costumes. Seriously one of the strangest films I\u2019ve ever seen and my favorite films are strange/weird ones.

{"query_id": "802", "query": "Male little person falls in love with red-headed woman .\n I hope someone can help me track down this movie. I may have some details mixed up, or combined with another drama, so if you have any suggestions at all, please share them. There is a Caucasian man, who is a little person, who is successful in his working life but is lonely in his private life. He may be a writer or editor, or some such professional. I think part of the plot is that he might have trouble making friends because some people are prejudiced against his size. Sometimes he abuses alcohol because of this. He re-connects with a woman he knew when he was a child, even though she used to tease him back when they were children. They become friends and eventually fall in love. She is a regular height woman, also Caucasian, slim and with red hair. In the last scene of the movie, they are dancing on a balcony or rooftop and she is wearing a white dress. Maybe it\u2019s their wedding? I have been through the filmographies of all the male Caucasian little people actors I can think of with no luck. My Googlefu has failed me as well. If you have any ideas at all, no matter how far fetched, please share them. Thank you in advance for any suggestions you may have."}

The main characters are a sister and her younger brother, a family friend who is like a big silent bouncer or bodyguard, and a young suave guy they meet. It\u2019s an adventure-fantasy in some sort of future dystopia. I remember a couple of scenes\u2026 Suave guy sees the sister fight off some military types and invites her to escape with him through a security checkpoint in the desert by racing their flying boards past the guards. They succeed in escaping, and are later joined by the brother and bodyguard dude, much to the chagrin of suave guy, who thought he was ditching the weaker elements. Sister says she would never leave them, they\u2019re her family. Later, the sister gets captured and taken to some sort of facility where she gets strapped to a gurney. She gets out of the straps by shimmying the gurney until the bottom release button is hit, then stretches her legs over her head to hit the top button. She wanders around the facility, running into the brother of a friend that is so doped up he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. She is recaptured, and suave guy and co. break in to save her. The group have almost made it to safety when their way is blocked and bodyguard dude has to sacrifice himself to ensure their escape. The final scene shows the kids running around a beach playing and enjoying their new-found freedom while suave guy does a voiceover.

A young man comes to a provincial seashore town having in his possession a piece of a metallic plate, decorated with strange symbols. As far as I recall they look like Phoenician alphabet. However, this is just a small piece of a bigger artifact, so this guy is looking for the rest of it. I really do not know why he comes to this particular town, most likely he has info that another piece is located somewhere around the area. Also there are other people looking for the same artifacts and they are in a competition. The movie is pivoting around this search and confrontation between the groups. So it\u2019s mostly an action movie. I remember this scene at the very end of the film, this is how the movie ends. The protagonist and his opponent are fighting on the beach, the hero overcomes his enemy and a wave carries out the pieces of the artifact into the sea. The protagonist is walking sadly along the shore and suddenly finds both pieces thrown ashore by the wave. So he takes these two pieces and moves to some different location continuing his search. The end has this feel of the Incredible Hulk TV series. I remember asking my father about these metallic plates and their meaning. He said something like: These were parts of an artifact left by extraterrestrials who visited Earth in ancient times, the text on the plates revealed the date of their return.
